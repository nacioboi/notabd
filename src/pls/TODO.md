# How to go from here with `PLS`?

Top priority:

- [ ] Fix the `InfoInjector.py` to work with the new `PLS` lib.
- [ ] Write a few tests in some other projects to test its usability.

Some other shits:

- [ ] Add a detailed documentation.
- [ ] Add a more generalized README.
- [ ] Add a `PLS` logo.
- [ ] Look at other more popular libs to see how ours stacks up and then add to this list accordingly.
