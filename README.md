# `bd` project by matrikater

## RIGHT NOW THE PROJECT IS A MESS :cry:

As of Friday, 2nd of Feb 2024, I am working on the `./src/tests.py` file.

As of Friday, 2nd of Feb 2024, inside this file, I am trying to get the `infoinject` module working.

Once we have the `infoinject` working, we can use it for extensive debugging information which will come in handy since we do actually want the code to be somewhat reliable.

## An idea for the logo

The `bd` kindof already looks like an owl. I think we could make it look more like an owl by adding some eyes and a beak.
This would work because owls have some of the best vision in the animal kingdom, and we want our code to have the best vision too.
