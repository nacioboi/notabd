# TODO: INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY PUTTING COMMANDS IN THE `proj_tester.py` FILE, WE CAN PUT THEM IN A SEPARATE FILE AND THEN CALL THAT FILE FROM THE `proj_tester.py` FILE. THIS WILL MAKE THE `proj_tester.py` FILE CLEANER AND EASIER TO READ.
# also, i have been running into issues with the `proj_tester.py` file, so i will try to use a separate file to run the commands and see if that works better.
